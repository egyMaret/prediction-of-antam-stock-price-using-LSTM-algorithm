Stocks are an important factor for a country's economy in the financial sector. Looking at the IDX data on September 25, 2024, there are more than 6 million investors in Indonesia. Being an investor has its own challenges when wanting to make investment decisions, because stock movements fluctuate and are difficult to predict.
To find a solution to the problem, the researcher created a model using LSTM which has the ability to remember the long term in time series data and learn patterns from fluctuating stock movements.
Some previous studies have shown success in the application of LSTM, such as the prediction of banking sector stock prices [5], [6]. There is also research conducted to predict stock prices during the COVID-19 pandemic which shows how global economic fluctuations can affect the stock market [7]. From the above research, LSTM is proven to be able to provide solutions in predicting stock prices for investors.
This research uses several parameters in the experiment. Such as the number of hidden layers, 3 optimizations, and the number of epochs. From all experiments, researchers get the best model in predicting the movement of the Close stock price of PT. Aneka tambang Tbk (ANTM) with an experiment of 2 hidden layers, Adam optimization, and epoch 100. The RMSE testing value produced in the best model is 37.133.
